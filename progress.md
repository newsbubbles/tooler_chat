- [x] API endpoints for agent management
- [x] API endpoints for MCP server management
- [x] API endpoints for chat sessions and messages
- [x] Streaming chat responses
- [x] Default Tooler agent initialization

#### Frontend (React)
- [x] Project setup with React and Material UI
- [x] Authentication store using Zustand
- [x] API service with Axios
- [x] Complete routing setup
- [x] Layout component with two-panel UI
- [x] Authentication pages (Login, Register)
- [x] Agent management components
- [x] MCP server management components
- [x] Chat interface with streaming support
- [x] State management for user, agents, MCP servers, chat sessions
- [x] Dialogs for creating and editing resources

#### DevOps
- [x] Docker configuration for backend, frontend, and database
- [x] Docker Compose setup for local development

## Features Implemented

### Authentication System
- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Session management

### Agent Management
- View all available agents
- Create custom agents

### Chat Interface
- Two-panel UI with left drawer for agent/session selection
- Right panel for MCP server management
- Chat sessions organized by agent
- Streaming responses from agents
- Markdown rendering with code highlighting
- Session management (create, rename, delete)

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - End-to-end testing of the application
   - Unit testing for critical components
   - Load testing for streaming functionality

2. **Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment
   - Create deployment documentation

3. **Enhancements**
   - Add user profile management
   - Implement message search functionality
   - Add export/import for agents and MCP servers
   - Create admin panel for user management

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- Users Table: Stores user information and authentication details
- Sessions Table: Manages user sessions with JWT integration
- Agents Table: Stores agent information including system prompts
- MCPServers Table: Stores MCP server code and configurations
- AgentMCPServer Table: Relationship between agents and MCP servers
- ChatSessions Table: Manages chat sessions between users and agents
- Messages Table: Stores chat messages with content and role

### Frontend State Management
- Authentication store: Manages user authentication state
- Agents store: Manages agent data and operations
- MCP servers store: Manages MCP server data and operations
- Chat store: Manages chat sessions and messages with streaming support

### API Endpoints
- User authentication: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register
- User management: /api/users/me
- Agent management: /api/agents (CRUD)
- MCP server management: /api/mcp-servers (CRUD)
- Chat session management: /api/chat/sessions (CRUD)
- Chat functionality: /api/chat/sessions/{id}/messages, /api/chat/sessions/{id}/messages/stream

## Future Ideas/Roadmap

- Enhanced agent capabilities with different model options
- User roles and permissions for team collaboration
- Admin dashboard for system management
- Analytics for agent usage and performance
- More sophisticated project management tools
- Integration with other AI services
- Export/import functionality for agents and MCP servers
- Mobile app version
- Notifications system
- Chat message search functionality
- Multi-language support
- Theme customization
